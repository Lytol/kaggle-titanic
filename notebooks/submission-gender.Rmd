title: "Prediction - By Gender"

```{r include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
source(here("R/titanic.R"))
```

This is intentionally a silly and straightforward prediction based solely on the gender of the passenger. If the passenger is the test set is male, we'll assume they did not survive; alternately, if a passenger is female, we'll assume that they did survive.

```{r}
submission_path <- here("data/submissions/gender.csv")

predictions <- test_data %>%
  mutate(Survived = ifelse(Sex == "male", 0, 1)) %>%
  write_predictions(submission_path)
```
